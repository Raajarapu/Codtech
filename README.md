**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

 1 -> Data collection :-
      The dataset is boston housing price prediction extracted from the kaggle website which consist of four labels 1)RM, 2)LSTAT,	3)PTRATIO and	4)MEDV.
      The target column is 'MEDV' and the remaining columns are treated as feature columns.
      The dataset has 489 rows and 4 columns without null values.
      
 2 -> Data prepocesssing :-
      Finding the top 5 rows including labels.
      Finding the last 5 rows.
      Finding the datatypes of all the columns
      Describing the statistical operation such as min, max, standard deviation, etc.
      Checking the null values.
      
 3 -> Data splitting :-
      The dataset is splitting into four parts such as X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test.
      The training dataset is 80%.
      The testing dataset is 20%.
      
 4 -> Model building :-
      Using LinearRegression model.
      Fitting the training datasets(X_train, y_train).
      Predicting the test dataset(X_test).
      
 5 -> Metrics calculation :-
      (MSE) Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and the actual target values within a dataset.
      (r2_score) It measures how well the model fits the data by assessing the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.
      
 6 -> Data visualization :-
      All variables are plotted with the target column.
      Visualizing the co-relation for those columns.
